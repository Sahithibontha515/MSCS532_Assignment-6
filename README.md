# 📚 Data Structures and Order Statistics in Python

This project implements fundamental **data structures** and **selection algorithms** in Python, as part of an academic assignment focused on understanding medians, order statistics, and their applications.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Array.py`  
  Implements a basic 1D Array with operations such as insertion, deletion, and access.

- `Matrix.py`  
  Implements 2D matrix operations such as creation, element access, and traversal.

- `StackAndQueue.py`  
  Contains implementations of Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) using arrays.

- `LinkedList.py`  
  Implements a singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and traversal functionalities.

- `KthSmallestElement.py`  
  Includes two algorithms for selecting the k-th smallest element:
  - **Deterministic Median of Medians** (worst-case linear time)
  - **Randomized Quickselect** (expected linear time)

- `main.py`  
  Entry point to run and test the implemented data structures and selection algorithms.
